Current flow:
1. GameStateController changes state -> Fires SharedEvents.PanelShow. 2. PanelNavigatorController receives event. 3. It finds the panel mapped to that state, shows it, and hides others.

I want a feature, which enables to show screen over other screen.
for example, when level failed screen is active then I want to give developer option weather to show it over gameplay screen or show only level failed. Did you understand the feature?
